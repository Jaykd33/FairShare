## 📝 Problem Statement

Managing shared expenses can be tricky. Whether you're on a **group trip**, sharing **rent**, or dividing a **bill**, it’s easy to lose track of who paid what and how much everyone owes. This leads to confusion, frustration, and sometimes disagreements.

### Simple Example Scenario 🤔:
Imagine you went on a dayout with 3 of your friends: Keshav, Harsh and Sohan. 
- **Keshav** paid ₹495 for a cab 🚗.
- **Sohan** paid ₹780 for lunch 🍽️.
- **Keshav** again paid ₹950 for games 🎳.
- **Harsh** paid ₹255 for metro 🚇.
  (Practically, No person has huge amount of money to pay all the bills at every place)

At the end of the day, everyone should pay their fair share. Each person should spend equal amount as they've spent the whole day together. The total expense maybe some amount, but who owes whom, and how much? Calculating this manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors especially when there are more number of people involved and larger number of expenditure transactions done by them. That's where **FairShare** comes in! 🎉
